Every week, the LEC’s general population votes on the governing candidates on Saturday. The deadline is by the end of Sunday.

Those who do not vote will have to pay a fee of 4 stacks of cobblestone and half a stack of coal to the government.

When results are done, then they are counted and the top two are inaugurated as president. The leading third will become a vice president.

If any position is tied, then a candidate at random between ones who had the same number of votes is chosen.


Starting from Monday, one of the two presidents will become the “Crown”. The Crown will have the full presidential power that is available to them. Every two days, the Crown position will switch between presidents. This means that the other president becomes the Crown on Wednesday, etc.

The presidents do NOT have the power to make, break, or amend laws without the Court’s consent.

The Crown/president does NOT have the ability to inhabit each other’s abilities. Their rights are protected from each other by the Court. The Crown/president MAY NOT MANIPULATE ELECTIONS in any way or form. Failure to follow these rules will be outlined in Article 3.

By Monday, both positions of the Crown and president are redistributed to the newly elected.
